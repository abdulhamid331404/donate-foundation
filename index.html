            <p>
                If you don't know, you will be happy. We have undertaken several types of projects. For which we are
                constantly working. <br> Which includes education, accommodation and food.</p>

                <h2>Food for a family</h2>
                <p>Food is one of the basic necessities. We are making arrangements to provide various types of food to
                    the wild people so that they do not suffer from malnutrition due to lack of food.</p>

                <p>eople need houses to protect themselves from various natural disasters. Their lives are now very
                    risky after they lost their home. So we are providing shelter for them so that their lives are not
                    threatened.</p>

                <p>Education is like the eye of human life. A nation that is ignorant about education is deprived of
                    everything in this world. We are working for those who are in the wild and those who are moving away
                    from education due to various disasters.</p>
